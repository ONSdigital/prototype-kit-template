# prototype-kit-template

This is a template for a [prototype-kit](https://github.com/ONSdigital/prototype-kit) project which can be used as a starting point when creating new prototypes. This provides access to the ONS design system to render page layouts and components.

## Getting setup with this template

Install the latest version of the ONS design system:

```bash
yarn add @ons/design-system
```

## How to use this project?

This project comes with the following commands:

- `yarn start` - Builds prototype content and starts a local server for previewing content changes. The command displays the URL for accessing the local server.

- `yarn watch` - Starts a local server for previewing content changes. The command displays the URL for accessing the local server. Unlike `yarn start`, this command does not perform an initial build.

- `yarn build` - Builds prototype content as a static website to a 'build' directory inside this project. The output of this command could be used by a CI process to deploy the prototype website.

## Getting started

1. Create a directory alongside the 'example' prototype directory and then populate with files using 'example' as a starting point.

2. Create prototype by editing the prototype entry points (`index.njk`, `index.js` and `index.scss`).

3. Preview the prototype by running `yarn start`.

## How do the build commands work?

This project uses [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to automate the above commands. The [prototype kit]({{PROTOTYPE_KIT_HOMEPAGE}}) provides default gulp tasks which are used by this repository which are inherited in the `./gulpfile.js` script.

Additional gulp tasks can be added to this project's `gulpfile.js` in the usual way. Refer to the gulp documentation for information on how to do this.

## Using a specific version of the design system

Begin by adding a reference to the specific design system version in the `package.json` file of this repository; for example, if version 44.0.0 were required then this would look like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@ons/design-system/44.0.0": "npm:@ons/design-system@44.0.0",
  ...
```

And then add the `version` attribute at the top of each Nunjucks template that requires this specific design system version:

```nunjucks
---
version: 44.0.0
---
<p>This page uses design system version 44.0.0.</p>
```

### Custom JavaScript

If you need to add custom JavaScript to your prototype, the build system will automatically look for a file called `index.js` in your prototype. Gulp will convert your JavaScript to ES5 code. You can refer to the example folder to see how to include the JavaScript in your template.

### Custom CSS

If you need to add custom CSS to style a new component or override styling on an existing component you can create a `.scss` file in the directory of your prototype. Gulp will spit out a `.css` file named the same as any `.scss` file that isn't prefixed with an underscore. You can refer to the example folder to see how to include generated css in your template.
